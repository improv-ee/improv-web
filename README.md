This is the source code for https://improv.ee, a website dedicated to listing information and events about improvised theatre.

This project is archived and superceeded by https://github.com/improv-ee/improv-static

## Development

Configuration instructions are provided for a Linux (Ubuntu) based development environment.

### Needs to be installed

- [Docker][] (latest)
- [Docker Compose][] (latest)
- `openssl` (`apt-get install openssl`)
- [Composer][]
- [npm][]

### Setup

Install vendor packages:

```bash
cd src
composer install
npm install
```

Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will generate a new self-signed CA and certificates for local development. You need to
install your new Certificate Authority into your web browser. [Here is how](https://wiki.wmtransfer.com/projects/webmoney/wiki/Installing_root_certificate_in_Mozilla_Firefox)
to do it for Firefox (`Settings -> Certificate Authorities -> Add`). The CA file for importing
is `docker/lb/certs/ca.crt`. If done correctly, this will make `https://` "green" for our dev domains:

`web.local.improv.ee` will be the frontend webserver
`api.local.improv.ee` will be the API

DNS entries are already configured in global DNS to point to `127.0.0.1`.

Review settings in `src/.env` - this will be your local conf.

Bring up services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You need to bootstrap the database (once) and set up Laravel.

```bash
docker-compose run webserver bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan passport:install
```

If all goes well you should have Docker containers running, database bootstrapped and webpages
(with green HTTPS) opening on `web.local.improv.ee` and `api.local.improv.ee`.


## API documentation

API documentation is generated from API source code using [apidoc-generator](https://github.com/mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator).
To change it, change PHP code comments on API controllers (`src/app/Http/Controllers/Api/`).

### Regenerate documentation

Run:

```bash
$ php artisan apidoc:generate
```

Open `public/doc/index.html` with a local webbrowser.

## External services in use

### AWS S3

S3 buckets are used for data storage (ex: uploaded images). See `config/filesystems.php` for more.

### Google Cloud

Google Translate is used for translating text - see `config/googletranslate.php` for more.

Google Places is used for fetching Place information.
